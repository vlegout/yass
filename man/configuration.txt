yass.configuration(5)
=====================

NAME
----
yass.configuration - yass configuration files

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This man page documents how yass configuration files must be
formatted. There are two types of configuration files: to describe a
task set and a processor.

Configuration files must use json.

TASK SET
--------
The file must contain a array named "tasks", and each entry in this
array is a task. A task can be specified with the following fields
(*bold* fields are mandatory):

- *id*: Id of the task. Must be an integer.

- *wcet*: Worst Case Execution Time of the task. Must be an integer
  greater than 20 (YASS_MIN_WCET in libyass/common.h). Must be less
  than the deadline and the period.

- deadline: Deadline of the task. Must be an integer. If not
  specified, the deadline is equal to the period.

- *period*: Period of the task. Must be an integer.

- delay: If this field is greater than 0, the task will not start at
  tick = 0 but when tick = delay.

- threads: Number of threads for the task. (Default: 1).

- segments: Used by the forkjoin task model. Must be an array
  containing multiple wcet entries (Default: NULL).

- parallel: Also used by the forkjoin task model, number of threads to
  run in parallel. (Default: -1).

PROCESSOR
---------
This file must contain at least one field, the _name_ of
processor. There are two other fields, for available speeds and low
power states.

The _speed_ field is an array. Each element of the array must contain
two fields, one is speed (a float between 0 and 1) and the other is
consumption (also a float between 0 and 1).

The _states_ field is an array, each element of the array must contain
two fields, on is consumption (a float between 0 and 1 and the other
is penalty (integer, count the number of ticks required to wake the
processor up).

=================

NAME
----
yass.interface - yass output formats

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manpage documents the file format used by yass and yass-draw.

DRAW
----

The file format should provide enough information to draw the schedule
timeline. It is event based and each event can provide up to five
arguments (each argument must be an integer). The list of known events
is stored in the yass_events enumeration in the libyass/common.h
file. Below is a description of each event.

- Task Release. Indicate when a task is released. Contains two
  arguments, the id of the released task and the tick when the task is
  released.

- Task Deadline. Indicate when a task reaches its deadline. Contains
  two arguments, the id of the task and the tick when the task reaches
  its deadline.

- Task Run. Indicate when a task starts its execution on a given
  processor. If the task is preempted from another processor, the
  event must be activated to indicate on which processor the task now
  runs. Contains four arguments, the index of the scheduler used, the
  id of the task, the tick and the processor.

- Task Terminate. Indicate when a task finishes its execution on a
  given processor. It could be because the task reaches its WCET or
  because the task has been preempted. Contains four arguments, the
  index of the scheduler used, the id of the task, the tick and the
  processor.

- Cpu Speed. Indicate that a processor changes its speed. Contains
  three arguments, the index of the scheduler used, the processor and
  the new speed (between 0 and 100).

- Cpu Mode. Indicate that a processor changes its mode of
  operation. Contains three arguments, the index of the scheduler
  used, the processor and the new mode. Active mode are integers
  greater than or equal to 0 and mode less than 0 are inactive mode
  (see YASS_CPU_MODE_NORMAL and YASS_CPU_MODE_WAKEUP in
  libayss/common.h).

- Cpu Consumption. Indicate that the processor consumption
  changes. Contains four arguments, the index of the scheduler used,
  the processor, the new consumption (between 0 and 100) and the tick
  indicating when the update takes place.
